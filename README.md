This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. 

Run the development server after you've navaigated to the project directory (whats-wrong-with-emery):

```bash
npm run dev # use this one if you are using Node
# or
yarn dev # ignore this if you do not have Yarn
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
